# Radial Bass Membrane System PsuedoCode. 

#The Radial Bass Membrane System visualizes the low end of a mix using a vibrating planar membrane. It merges two radial heightmapsâ€”a kick pulse and a low-end radial FFT

# Kick pulse parameters
pulse_height = 1.0       # Amplitude of each radial pulse
pulse_width = 0.1        # How wide the pulse front appears
pulse_speed = 2.0        # Base speed of radial propagation
pulse_lambda = lambda t: pulse_speed  # Optional dynamic speed modifier

# FFT parameters
fft_low = 0              # Low cutoff frequency (Hz)
fft_high = 200           # High cutoff frequency (Hz)
fft_bins = 32            # Number of FFT bins to represent

# Terrain grid parameters
grid_size = 128          # 2D grid size: grid_size x grid_size
origin = (grid_size // 2, grid_size // 2)  # Center of grid

# === SYSTEM STATE ===
